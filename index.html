            The thinker thinks of a number from <span id="min"></span> to <span id="max"></span> inclusive.
            The guesser has 7 guesses to guess the number. If they take more than 7 guesses to guess the number, they lose. The guesser can't guess anything other than a number, or they lose.
            Every time the guesser guesses, the thinker must (honestly) give one of three responses: your guess is too big, your guess is too small, or your guess is the correct number. If the number is correct, the guesser wins.
            There's a catch. Every time the answer is "too big", the guesser loses a life. The guesser has three lives at the start of the game. If they have no lives left, they lose.
